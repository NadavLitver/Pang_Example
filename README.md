# Pang_Example
 Small pang game using MVC And Dependency Injection
 
I chose to implement Dependency Injection to make a loosly coupled application and to increase modularity, testability of the project. 

I chose to use the MVC implementation to manage the relationship between the user interface and underlying data efficiently, I made sure to seperate the groups using assembly refernces and namespaces.

I added multiple Levels to make the game more challenging and show how I would tackle levels in a data-driven approach.

I added visuals and sounds because they are easy and fun :).
